Learning about AI while building a steampunk personality

# Step 1: Gather texts
This is my first attempt at building an AI from scratch. I'm beginning by gathering documents to use to train my model. Since I want this to have a steampunk feel, I think using a combination of text from the Victorian era ([Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), my library, and maybe newspapers if I can find them freely available) and modern steampunk novels (my own library). I may also try to incorporate words from the [Grandiloquent Word of the Day](https://www.grandiloquentwordoftheday.com/) and other internet resources I may come across. I'll update this list in my notes file, which is included in the notes folder in this repository.
